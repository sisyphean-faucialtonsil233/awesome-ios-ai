# Awesome iOS AI [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Making AI coding assistants experts at Swift and iOS development.

AI coding tools write Swift like it is 2020. They use `ObservableObject` when `@Observable` exists. They ignore actor isolation. They produce views with no accessibility modifiers. Skills, agents, and MCP servers fix that by giving AI assistants expert-level Swift knowledge on demand.

## Skills

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) are an open standard for giving AI coding agents specialized knowledge. Skills work across GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and more. Install any skill with the [skills CLI](https://skills.sh/docs/cli): `npx skills add <owner/repo@skill-name> -g -y`
